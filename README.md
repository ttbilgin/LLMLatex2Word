# LaTeX to DOCX Converter for LLM Outputs

A Python-based application that converts LaTeX documents (especially those generated by AI language models like ChatGPT or Claude) into Microsoft Word (DOCX) format. The application provides a user-friendly GUI interface and maintains formatting while converting mathematical equations.

## Features

- Converts LaTeX equations to native Word equations
- Maintains text formatting including bold text
- Preserves paragraph justification
- User-friendly GUI interface
- Real-time conversion
- Supports common LaTeX math environments
- Automatic opening of converted documents
- Times New Roman font with 11pt size

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Microsoft Word (required for opening the converted documents)

## Required Packages

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install python-docx
pip install lxml
pip install latex2mathml
pip install tkinter
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/latex-docx-converter.git
cd latex-docx-converter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure both `latexdocx_gui.py` and `MML2OMML.XSL` are in the same directory.

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python latexdocx_gui.py
```

2. The GUI window will appear with a text input area.

3. Paste your LaTeX content into the text area.

4. Click the "CONVERT TO MSWORD" button.

5. The converted document will automatically open in Microsoft Word.

### Example Input

```latex
In this study, $\mathbf{XGBoost-based\:imputation}$ was implemented through 
a systematic machine learning approach.

The model is trained by minimizing the \textbf{regularized objective function}:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 + \sum_{k=1}^K \Omega(f_k)
\]
```

## Supported LaTeX Features

- Mathematical equations (inline and display mode)
- Bold text using `\textbf{}`
- Basic text formatting
- Common mathematical symbols
- Subscripts and superscripts
- Matrices and arrays
- Greek letters
- Mathematical operators

## Limitations

- Does not support LaTeX packages and custom commands
- Limited support for complex table structures
- Does not support LaTeX figures and diagrams
- Some complex mathematical structures might not convert perfectly
